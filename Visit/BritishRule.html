<!--About Kanchipuram-->

<div class="subheadtxt">British Colonization (1750 – 1947)  </div>
<br />
<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>English East India Company</strong> - The English East India Company and the French East India Company often entered into conflict in the Coromandel coast of Tamil Nadu during most of the time in 18th Century. The French were relative newcomers to India. The French East India Company was formed in 1664 and in 1666 the French representatives obtained Aurangzeb’s permission to trade in India. The French soon setup trading posts in Pondicherry on the Coromandel coast. They occupied Karaikkal in 1739 and Joseph François Dupleix was appointed Governor of Pondicherry. In Europe the War of the Austrian Succession began in 1740 and eventually the British and the French forces in India were caught up in the conflict. There were numerous naval battles between the two navies along the Coromandel coast. The French led by La Bourdonnais attacked the poorly defended Fort St. George in Madras in 1746 and occupied it. The war in Europe ended in 1748 and with the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle Madras was restored to the British.  </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt">The conflict between the British and the French continued, this time in political rather than military terms. Both the Nawab of the Carnatic and Nizam of Hyderabad positions were taken by rulers who were strongly sympathetic to the French. Chanda Sahib had been made Nawab of the Carnatic with Dupleix's assistance, while the British had taken up the cause of the previous incumbent, Mohammed Ali Khan Walajah. In the resultant battle between the rivals, Clive assisted Mohammed Ali by attacking Chanda Sahib's fort in Arcot and took possession of it in 1751. The French assisted Chanda Sahib in his attempts to drive Clive out of Arcot. However the big army posted in Arcot and assisted by the French was defeated by the British. This is known as the famous Battle of Arcot. The Treaty of Paris (1763) formally confirmed Mohammed Ali as the Nawab of the Carnatic. It was a result of this action and the increased British influence that in 1765 the Emperor of Delhi issued a Firman (decree) recognizing the British possessions in southern India. </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>British Government Control</strong> - Although the Company was becoming increasingly bold and ambitious in putting down resisting states, it was getting clearer day by day that the Company was incapable of governing the vast expanse of the captured territories. Opinion amongst the members of the British Parliament urged the government to control the activities of the Company. The Company's financial position was also bad and it had to apply for a loan from Parliament. Seizing this opportunity, the Parliament passed the Regulating Act (also known as East India Company Act) in 1773. The act set down regulations to control the Company Board and created the position of the Governor General. Warren Hastings was appointed the first Governor-General. In 1784 Pitt's India Act made the Company subordinate to the British Government. 
</div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>End of the Company Rule</strong> - The discontent in the various districts of the Company territories exploded into what is termed as Sepoy Mutiny in 1857 and reached major war like proportions. Although the rebellion had a huge impact on the state of the colonial power in India, Tamil Nadu was mostly unaffected by it. In consequence of the war, the British Government enacted the Act of 1858 to abolish the powers of the Company and transfer the government to the Crown. </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Direct Rule by the British Crown</strong>In 1858 the British Crown assumed direct rule in India. During the early years the government was autocratic in many ways. The opinion of Indians in their own affairs was not considered by Britain as important. However, in due course the British Raj began to allow Indians participation in local government. Viceroy Ripon passed a resolution in 1882, which gave a greater and more real share in local government to the people. Further legislation such as the 1892 Indian councils Act and the 1909 "Minto-Morley Reforms" eventually led to the establishment of the Madras Legislative Council. The non-cooperation movement started under Mahatma Gandhi's leadership led the British government to pass the Government of India Act (also known as Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms) of 1919. First elections were held for the local assemblies in 1921.   </div> 
    
<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Kanchi under the British Rule</strong> -  The British coined the name Conjeevaram, the anglicised version of Kanchipuram. Under the British regime, a Collector to the district was appointed for the first time in 1788 AD. The district was further split up into two divisions, Northern and Southern, and was placed under the administration of two Collectors. The Collectors during 1790's were Clerk and Balfour. Lionel Place, the Collector in 1794-1799, created the posts of Sharistadars, who came under the control of the Collector. Clerks were also appointed to assist the Sharistadars. The famous Madurantakam and Uthiramerur tanks were created by Place. Hodgson, who was Head Assistant to Place, succeeded him as the Collector. The place he resided at Kanchipuram is still known in the name of Hodgsonpet. In 1800, Hodgson was succeeded by his Senior Assistant, Greenway. In the nineteenth century, Karunguzhi became the headquarters of the district and it remained so up to 1859 when it was shifted to 'Home Garden' Saidapettai, except for a short spell from 1825-1835 during which Kanchipuram served as the district headquarters. From 1859 to 1968, the Collector's office was located in Saidapettai. During the famous Siege of Arcot, Robert Clive made the Ekambara Nathar temple premises as a military camp. Due to artillery fighting the hits of cannon balls can be seen in the Rajagopuram of the temple. Robert Clive also donated jewels to the Varadaraja Perumal temple.   </div>
