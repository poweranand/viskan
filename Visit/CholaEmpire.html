<!--About Kanchipuram-->

<div class="subheadtxt">The Chola Empire (850 AD – 1279 AD)</div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">After the 6th Century AD, the ancient Sangam-period Tamil kingdoms lost their significance in the political map of south India. Even though the Pandiyas and the Cheras continuously registered their presence in their respective territories, the Cholas could not be traced. But their descents somehow survived and silently waited for the right time to rise above. After a gap of nearly 600 years, during the 9th Century AD they emerged like a phoenix in the political horizon. The circumstances were conducive and their innate urge was exemplary, both of which took them to greater heights. The Cholas of the medieval period established the most powerful of all empires in south India. They extended their northern border up to Orissa and even once touched the banks of Ganges. The southern most Ceylon, Kerala and the western coast were controlled by them. They had a strong sea army with which they occupied the South-East Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. After the fall of Pallavas, the history of Kanchipuram was inter-twined associated with the Cholas </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Kanchi Conquered</strong> - By the end of the 9th Century AD, The Pallavas and the Pandiyas often clashed for supremacy, the then major powers of Tamil region at that time.  But the Pallava kingdom was already losing ground due to the in-fight between the last of the Pallava kings Nirupathunga Varman and Aparajtha Varman. The battle at Tiruppurambiyam in 895 AD was important in this regard and paved the way for rise of Chola power. In this battle Nirupatungan was supported by Pandiya King Varagunan II and Aparajithan was supported by Chola king Adithan I (871 – 907 AD) and Ganga king Prithvipathi I. After fierce battle Aparajithan won and ruled for another 18 years. But eventually the Chola king Adithan subdued Aparajithan and annexed the Thondai Nadu with the Chola kingdom. Hence he got the title, ‘Thondai Nadu Paavina Cholan’ (meaning the Chola king who occupied Thondai Nadu). The Kanyakumari inscription mentions, ‘ Adithan won the Pallava king seated on the elephant’. This Adithan was the son of Vijayalayan (850 – 871 AD), the first Chola king of medieval period. This marks the descent of Pallavas and the ascent of Cholas. This victory of Thondai Nadu was very crucial for their future prospects of Cholas in the ensuing years. To signify this, they thereafter called Thondai Nadu as ‘Jayam Konda Chola Mandalam’ (meaning the victorious Chola region). </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Kanchi Lost</strong> - The first Chola king Vijayalayan’s inscription issued during the fourth year of his rule refers to the first entry of Cholas in to Kanchi. While his son Adithan defeated the Pallavas in the north, his grandson Paranthakan I defeated the Pandiyas and Sinhalese in the south and expanded the Chola kingdom. He stationed his elder son Rajadhithan in Kanchipuram to guard the northern borders. The chieftains in the Nellore region who did not accept the might of the Cholas sought the help of Rashtrakuta king Krishna III. In a war at Takkolam near Kanchipuram the Chola prince Rajadhithan was killed during action. In a dramatic turn of events the city of Kanchi fell into the hands of Rashtrakuta king. Thus the northern region of the Chola kingdom was under his control for 25 years. Thus the Rashtrakuta king obtained the title ‘Kachium Thanjayum Konda Kannara Devan’ (occupier of Kanchipuram and Thanjavur).  The inscriptions of Paranthakan have been found in the Kailasa Nathar temple. They term this temple as ‘Tirukkatrali (meaning holy stone temple). He gave many gifts to this temple and the Ekambara Nathar temple. </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Kanchi Regained</strong> - The Thondai Nadu and Kanchipuram were again won over by Rajarajan I  who expanded his empire up to Orissa in the north and down to Sri Lanka in the south. His son Rajendran I took the mighty of the Chola power to unprecedented heights. He won regions up to the Ganges in the north and accordingly got the title ‘Gangai Kondan’ (meaning one won the regions of Ganges river belt). Further with his strong naval forces he also won the kingdoms in South-East Asia. The inscriptions of Rajarajan and Rajendran can be seen in the Kanchi Kamakshi Amman temple and the Kachapeswarar temple who patronized these temples.  Kanchi became an important seat of political power during the reign of Kulothungan I. He made many architectural additions and improvements in the existing temples of Kanchipuram and made many land donations to them.   </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Kanchi Lost Forever</strong> - Most of the Chola inscriptions found in Kanchipuram were issued by Rajaraja III.  During his reign Kanchi became an important place of power equations. Because in this period, the Cholas, Pandiyas, Hoysalas of Karnataka, Kakatiyas of Andhra and the Kadavarayas struggled for power; aligned and realigned with each other to gain supremacy. All these activities occurred around the Kanchipuram region. In the end the Cholas lost the game, lost Kanchi and the stage set for the final demise of Chola stronghold.  Due to internal struggles the Cholas had only weak authority in the northern Thondai Nadu region. In 1219 AD, the Pandiya king Maravarman invaded the Chola kingdom and put into fire its cities Thanjavur and Uraiyur. But restored the regions he won to Cholas as Rajarajan III aligned with the formidable Hoysala king Veerasimhan. In 1231 AD, the Hoysalas again saved the Chola kingdom from the threats of Pandiyas but in turn they stationed a huge army of them near Kanchipuram and virtually took over the northern regions of Chola empire.  In 1257 AD, the Pandiya king Jatavarman invaded the Chola country defeated Rajendran III and dealt the final blow to the Chola power in Tamil soil. This Pandiya king took over kanchi and assumed the titles ‘Kanchi Kondan’ and ‘Kanchi Varadeeswara’ (meaning the occupation of Kanchipuram). He even issued coins from Kanchi in his names.</div>
