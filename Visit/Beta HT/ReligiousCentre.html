<!--About Kanchipuram-->

<div class="subheadtxt">Religious Centre</div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">Kanchipuram was one of the important places in the annals of the history of religion in India. It has the distinction of accommodating the major religions of Ancient India – Saivism, Vaishnavism, Buddhism and Jainism. The leaders and ideologues of these religions chose Kanchi as their head-quarters scholars to set up monasteries, to engage in philosophical debates etc. Even though these religions had uncompromising positions and even showed enmity in standpoints, they coexisted in Kanchi.  The city of Kanchi itself was divided into Siva Kanchi, Vishnu Kanchi, Jina Kanchi and Buddha Kanchi. Among these four, the first two divisions are still followed.  </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt">Saivism – There are five Siva temples in Kanchipuram which were sanctified by the verses of Samayakkuravars, the prominent four among the 63 Nayanmars.   They are Aneka Thangapada Eswarar temple, Ekambara Nathar temple, Onakantha Eswarar temple, Tirukkaleeswarar temple and Tirumetrali Eswarar temple. Of these five temples the Ekambara Nathar temple is very old and mythologies knitted around it are unique and popular. Moreover all the four Samayakkuravars sang verses on it. Including these five sanctified temples nearly 108 Saivite temples are spread all over the Kanchi town area – all are old and each one of them having a distinct mythological background.  The architectural marvel, Kailasa Nathar temple is a standing example of the development of Saivism in Kanchi. Its creator, the Pallava King Narasimha Varman II presented himself through his inscriptions as a stauch Saivite. Siva Chudamani was one of the titles he bore. The big temples such as, Kachapa Eswarar temple, Kamakshi Amman temple and Kumarakkottam are also strongly rooted in Saivite tradition. Even though Kamakshi Amman temple belongs to the Saktham tradition (Goddess worship) it cannot be separated from Saivism. All the Saivite sects such as Pasupatham, Kalamukham and Kapalikam existed and flourished in Kanchi. The satiric Sanskrit literary work of Pallava King Mahendra Varman presents an excellent picture of trends of Saivism of Kanchi during the 6th Century AD. Even though the king viewed Saivism from the standpoint of a Jainist (Mahendravarman was a follower of Jainism at that time and soon to become a Saivist) there was no prejudice except for satirical comments. The Kapalika sect followed extreme ways to attain salvation – drinking liquor, wearing attractive dresses and enjoying the lovely face of the beloved women were considered as paths for this purpose. The Kapalikas - the followers of Kapalikam - pursued a free life without any social bonds. Even though they dreamt about a life full of exotic happiness, they were mostly in poverty and led a life of dependence – but not caring much about the future. Occasionally these Kapalikas –– visited the Ekambara Nathar temple in Kanchipuram. They were termed as Dushta Kapalikas (meaning devilish). The Ekambara Nathar temple was called in earlier days only as ‘Ekambam’ meaning a single shaft. The word ‘Ekamra’ and the mango tree mythology were constructed only later.   </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt">Vaishnavism – Out of the 108 Divya Desams (Vaishnavite temples or shrines sanctified by the hymns of Azhwars) eighteen are situated in the Kanchipuram town itself. The Yathokthakari Perumal temple was the oldest one and finds reference in the Sangam literature Perumpanatruppadai. Poigai Azhwar, the first and foremost among the twelve Azhwars was born in Kanchipuram. The Divya Prabandham originated from his first Tiruvandhadhi. He also takes credit for being the first person to write Vedic philosophy in Tamil and in poetic form. In this respect, it can be said that the great Vaishnavite tradition of South India was originated in Kanchipuram. The fourth among the twelve Azhwars, Tirumazhisai Azhwar lived in Tiruvekka at Kanchi with his disciple Kanikannan.  Ramanujar, who established Vaishnavism as an organized religion and provided the strong philosophical foundation called Visishtadvaita, stayed at Kanchi for learning during his younger days. In Kanchi he was identified by Saint Alavandar as the future leader of Vaishnavism. Vedanta Desikar, one of the great teachers of Vaishnavism was born in Kanchi. He was a great intellectual, philosopher and authored more than 100 texts. During his time he surpassed all opponents of Vaishnavism through debates. Prativati Bayangaram Annam , who wrote the famous ‘Venkatesa Suprabhatham was also born in Kanchi. Tiruvaimozhi written by Nammaznwar which is also known by the name ‘Dravida Veda Sagaram’ was summarized by Nambi Pillai. But for some reasons it was kept incognito. This book was first published as ‘Yatindra Vaishnava Prabhavam’ at Kanchipuram. Sri Bhashyam written by Ramanujar was compiled into a text by Sudarsana Acharya, a disciple of Ramanujar. This text also originated at Kanchi. A doyen of the Vaishnavism, Prativati Bayangaram Annangarachariar was also a native of Kanchi. He has published more than 1000 religious texts. He was the recipient of President’s award and his birth centenary was celebrated all over Tamil Nadu.</div>

<div class="contentcenter txt">Jainism - The entry of Jainism in to Tamil Nadu is associated with Chandragupta Maurya’s retirement in Karnataka. It is widely believed that when his kingdom was devastated by a famine, Chandragupta renounced his throne on the advice of his spiritual preceptor Bhadrabahu and travelled to South India. Settling down in Karnataka, he is said to have taken to ‘Sallekhana’ (the Jain ascetic tradition of giving up one’s body by renouncing movement and eating). The place where he stayed became the Shravanabelagola of later times with the erection of the magnificent monolithic statue of Gomateshwara. Jainism entered Kanchipuram not long after Chandragupta’s passing. Though the age of Jainism in Tamil Nadu has not been exactly determined, it presence can be traced back to the Sangam era. The monks belonging to the religion were known as ‘Samanar’ and the householders As ‘Savakar’. Jainism is also known in Tamil Nadu as  Samana religion. The monasteries were known as Samana palli (like the Buddhist Vihara) and functioned as organized educational institutions. Kanchipuram, being the capital of the Tondaimandalam  was not insulated from this sweep of Jainism all through South India. The Pallava king Simhavishnu, who ruled from Kanchipuram, was a follower of Vaishnavism, but he did not look down upon other religions. His son Mahendravarman I (Seventh Century AD) was drawn to Jainism early in life. The wonderful cave temple at Sittannavasal is attributed to his munificence. Located in the Pudukottai area, the cave has frescoes on Jain spiritual themes like the Samavasarana (divine pavilion) Lake. It is significant that Mahendravarman’s drama, Matta-vilasa-prahasana, which is a satire on the ways of the Pashupatas, the Kapalikas, and the Buddhists, avoids any criticism of Vaishnavism, popular Saivism, or Jainism. Literature has kept alive some of Jainism’s old connections with Tondaimandalam. The author of the Jain epic ‘Chulamani’ is associated with Karvetinagar near Tirupati. At a distance of ten miles from Kanchipuram is Tirupanambur, where the Jain acharya Akalanka lived. He is said to have defeated the Buddhists in a debate in the court of King Himasitala of Kanchi. The eminent Jain commentator Suranandi lived in Tiruparuttikunram. ‘Merumandara Puranam’ is the legend of the two assistants of the thirteenth Tirthankara, Vimalanatha. This narrative in thirteen cantos about the princes Meru and Mandara is attributed to Mallisena Vamana (Fourteenth Century AD) who lived in Kanchipuram. The impressions of his feet and those of his disciple Pushpasena are honoured in the Chandraprabha temple at Tiruparuttikunram in Kanchi. The village of Tiruparuttikunram and the surrounding places are called as Jina Kanchi. </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt">Buddhism - The Girnar inscription of Emperor Ashoka in Gujarat and Tamil Sangam literary works like Natrinai and Maduraikkanji have references to Buddhism. The latter work gives description about women going to a Buddhist Vihara for worship. Manimekalai, the epic poem of the later Sangam age elaborately describes the events that take place in Kanchi that are related to Buddhism. The central character of this primarily  Buddhist epic is Manimekalai, who was a dancer before but later became a nun. She obtains the Amuda Surabhi (nectar vessel) which produces food without end. This she uses for performing charity. In the course of her travels, she is directed by her grandfather Masattuvan to go to Kanchi, as the city had been devastated by a drought. When she goes there, she finds a temple of Buddha at the very centre of the city: The king builds a garden in honour of Manimekalai’s coming to help his people. Delighted, Manimekalai makes him build a lotus seat for Buddha. She then places the Amuda Surabhi on the lotus seat and welcomes all living beings to gather to be fed. She then meets her spiritual teacher, Aravana Adikal, who instructs her in the Dharma. Her mind illumined, Manimekalai dedicates herself to the ideal life that leads to salvation. There is a place called Arappanancheri, where the sage Aravana Adigal is said to have spent the latter part of his life. Today the place is known as Arapperumchelvi Street (Maid of Great Charity). History records the names of several great Buddhists of Kanchipuram who spread the Dharma all over the world. Buddhaghosha (Fifth Century AD), along with the monks Sumati and Jotipala, lived in Kanchi. Aniruddha, author of Abhidhammatthasangaha, lived in the Mulasoma Vihara. </div>     

<div class="contentcenter txt">A Pallava king named Buddhavarman apparently built many viharas.  Acharya Dharmapala, who entered the Sangha on the eve of his wedding, lived in Patatitta Vihara built by Ashoka near Kanchipuram. He wrote Pali commentaries for some of the Tripitaka texts. He taught at Nalanda University but died young at the age of thirty-two. Ashoka’s closeness to Kanchi has been recorded by Hsuan Tsang, who says that a Buddhist stupa built by him was still standing four centuries later. Deepankara Thero, author of the Pali work Bhujja Madhu, lived in Balatissa Vihara in Kanchi. Ananda Thero of Kanchi was taken by addhamma Jotipala to Burma to spread Buddhism there. There are other revered names associated with Buddha Kanchi: Venudasa, Vajrabodhi, Sariputra Among the most famous Buddhists of ancient Kanchi are Dignaga and Bodhidharma. Hsuan Tsang, who visited Kanchipuram in the 7th Century AD, records that there were one hundred monasteries with ten thousand monks belonging to Theravada Buddhism following Dignaga’s yoga. Dignaga (Fifth Century AD) was a native of Kanchi and was born in Simhavaktra (Seeyamangalam). His Hetuchakra (Wheel of Reason) inaugurated Buddhist philosophical logic. Bodhidharma (Fifth Century AD) was a Brahmana prince of Kanchi who became a Buddhist and was trained in the techniques of meditation by Prajnatara. The areas now included in the Big Kanchipuram were once considered as Buddha Kanchi.</div>
