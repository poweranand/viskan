<!--About Kanchipuram-->

<div class="subheadtxt">Bahmani Sultans (1347 – 1527 AD)</div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">When already Kanchipuram become part of the Vijayanagar Empire by the end of the 14th Century, for a short while it came under the occupation of Bahmani Sultans. Bahmani Sultanate was one of the great medieval Indian kingdoms and was the first independent Islamic Kingdom in South India which ruled the Deccan region. It was founded in1347 AD by Alauddin Hassan Bahman Shah who was possibly of Tajik-Persian descent. He revolted against the Sultans of Delhi. His revolt was successful, and he established an independent state in Deccan within the Delhi Sultanate's southern provinces. The Bahmani capital was Ahsanabad (present day Gulbarga of Karnataka state). Then it was moved to Bidar. The Bahmanis contested with the Hindu Vijayanagar Empire to control the south. The sultanate reached the peak of its power during the vizierate of Mahmud Gawan (1466–1481). After 1518 the Sultanate broke up into five states: Ahmednagar, Berar, Bidar,  Bijapur and Golconda collectively known as the Deccan Sultanates. The Bahmani dynasty believed that they descended from Bahman, the legendary king of Iran. They were patrons of the Persian language, culture and literature, and some members of the dynasty were well-versed in that language and composed verses.</div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Kanchi under Bahmani Sultans</strong>Bahmani Sultan Muhammad Shah II (1463-1482 AD) assisted by his able minister Khwaja Mahmud Gawan engaged in a series of conquests in the south. In one among these raids Kanchipuram was captured and looted in 1481 AD, which was unprecedented and most terrible in its history. The writer Taba-Taba who lived under the royal patronage of the Sultans has given the historical account of capture of Kanchi in his work called Burhani Maasir, in the following words:</div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">“(While encamped at Malur in the Mysore State), the Sultan (Muhammad II) was informed that at a distance of fifty Farasakhs was a city called Ganja (Kanchi) situated in the centre of the dominion of that malignant one (Narasimha), containing temples which were the wonder of the age, filled with countless concealed treasures and jewels and valuable pearls besides innumerable slave girls. From the rise of Islam up to this time no Muhammadan monarch had set foot on it, no stranger had laid hand on the cheek of that idol temple; and it was suggested that if the Sultan were to send an expedition against it, immense booty and treasure would doubtless be obtained. The Sultan with nearly 10,000 horse made forced marches from that place, and after they had for one day and two nights travelled a long distance through an uneven country, on the morning of the second day which happened to be the 11th  of Muharram in the year 886 (12th March, 1481 AD) the Sultan with Nizamulmulk Bahri Khan-i-Azam Adil Khan and 150 special slaves of the Sultan, outstripped the whole army and having surrounded the city of Kanchi, entrapped the people of that city of sinners. Out of a number who had been appointed for the protection of the city and temples, some were put to the sword, whilst others by a thousand stratagems escaped with their lives, and took to flight. The royal troops moment by moment and hour by hour following one another were assembling till a large army was collected under the Sultan's standard. After that, at a sign from the Sultan, the troops took to plundering and devastating. They levelled the city and its temples with the ground and overthrew all the symbols of infidelity and such a quantity of jewels, valuable pearls, slaves and lovely maidens and all kinds of rarities fell into their hands that they were beyond computation"</div>

<div class="contentcenter txt">After a gap of nearly five years the city of Kanchi again went into the fold of Vijayanagar Empire during the reign of Saluva Narasimha (1486 – 1490 AD). </div>
