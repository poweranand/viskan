<!--About Kanchipuram-->

<div class="subheadtxt">Sources of Information</div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">Historians have done detailed research about the more than 2000 year old history of Kanchipuram. Ancient literary texts, legendary travelers’ accounts, and temple inscriptions are the authentic sources of information to know the history of Kanchi. The Sangam Tamil literature Perumpanatruppadai (3rd to 1st Century BC) and the Tamil epic Manimekalai (1st to 3rd Century AD) are the earliest literary sources to give an elaborate picture of Kanchi. Literary sources belonging to the medieval and modern periods give abundant information about Kanchi. Hieun-Tsang, the legendary traveler from China, upon his visit to Kanchi during the 7th Century AD, has given many valuable details in his travel account. Epigraphists have so far documented more than 650 inscriptions on the walls, pillars, pilasters and slabs of the temples in and around Kanchi. They pertain to various dynasties which ruled Kanchi in different time periods. </div>
<div class="subheadtxt">Thondai Nadu</div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">In the ancient period, Tamil speaking regions were divided into many Nadus (Tamil – land areas). Each Nadu belonged to a clan and ruled by a chieftain. With passage of time this clan society disappeared; numerous Nadu divisions merged; and in their place more powerful kingdoms arose. Only five Nadus survived the test of time. They are – Thondai Nadu (north part), Kongu Nadu (western part), Chola Nadu (central part), Pandiya Nadu (southern part) and Chera Nadu (western coast - present day Kerala). The regions in between the north Pennai river and south Pennai river is approximately called as Thondai Nadu. It contained the present day Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur, Chennai, Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram districts of Tamil Nadu and the Chittor and Nellore districts of Andhra Pradesh. Tribes such as Aruvar and Kurumbar who spoke a distinct dialect of Tamil language inhabited this region. Kanchipuram was at the centre of Thondai Nadu and decided its history over the ages. </div>
 <div class="subheadtxt">Pre-history</div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">Archaeological researches have brought into light evidences about people inhabiting many places of Kanchipuram district during the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic phases of the Stone Age. So far 32 Paleolithic sites have been found in the district and 4 among them are in the Kanchipuram taluk itself.  </div>
<div class="subheadtxt">Sangam Age (600 BC – 300 AD)</div>
<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Karikal Cholan</strong> - The wild forest regions of Thondai Nadu, and its original inhabitants came under the rule of Chola king Karikalan. He is said to have cleared the forests into cultivable agricultural land; dig many lakes for irrigation; and even many families from his Chola Nadu to settle here permanently. Karikalan fortified the city of Kanchipuram with huge walls and made it the head-quarters of Thondai Nadu. He is said to have ruled the region during the second century BC. The Sangam Tamil literature ‘Pattinappalai’ and the medieval period Saivite literature ‘Periya Puranam’ have reference for Karikalan’s rule in Kanchi. Medieval period Chola copper plate inscriptions also mention that Karikalan renovated Kanchi and built a wall around it. Thondai Nadu with Kanchi at its helm was made a buffer zone by king Karikalan to withstand the surge of invasions in the northern border of his Chola kingdom. </div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">There is an interesting legendary story related to Karikalan’s presence in Kanchi. In the Kanchi Kamakshi Amman temple, there is a small sannidhi in the inner Prakaram. The figure in that Sannidhi is called ‘Meichathan’. He is one of the guards to the Goddess. Below the Sannidhi a song is written. Actually this song was quoted by scholar Adiyarkku Nallar in his narrative to the Tamil epic Silappadikaram. This quotation song mentions about king Karikalan. It says that when Karikalan traveled towards north India, he came to Kanchi and worshipped Kamakshi Amman. While leaving, he took the whip named ‘Chendu’held by Meichathan. With its power, he defeated all the kings who opposed him in the north. Upon reaching Himalayas, he inscribed on the top of the hill, the figure of tiger – royal symbol of his kingdom.  </div>     
<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Thondaiman Ilantirayan</strong> -  Another Sangam Tamil literature Perumpanatruppadai records the fact that King Ilanthirayan ruled Thondai Nadu with Kanchi as its headquarters. This is the earliest literary work to provide an elaborate description of Kanchi. The city was beautiful, well planned and well protected. It was located in the southern bank of the Kambai river. Apart from the huge walls, it also had natural protection by thick forests in the outer. Heavy chariots often plied through its streets. Business was very brisk in its busy markets and people most of the time engaged themselves in festivities. It resembled the shape of the lotus issuing out of the navel of God Vishnu. The Yathothkari Perumal temple has also been referred to by the author of this work.  </div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">There is a lake near Kanchipuram named ‘Tirayaneri’ bearing the name of the king Ilan Tirayan. He could have ruled the region during the first century BC. Probabaly, after Karikalan his descendans might have appointed Ilantirayan as their deputy in Kanchi. But, there is no reference about the Karikalan’s rule of Kanchi in Perumpanatruppadai. The epic Manimekali contains a legendary story about the birth of Ilantirayan.  Once the Chola king named Killi went to Nagalokam. He married Naga princess Peelivalai and gave birth to a son. While returning back, the ship in which they traveled was drowned due to storm. Luckily his son escaped the tragedy and washed ashore alive. The Cholas identified the child as it wore jewels peculiar to them. As the child was brought back to shores by sea waves, they named him ‘Tirayan’. Tirai in Tamil means ‘wave’. The young Tirayan was made a ruler of Thondai Nadu. </div>
<div class="subheadtxt">The Interregnum  - The Kalabhras (300 AD – 600 AD)</div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">The earlier Chola kingdom was constantly attacked by Pandiyas in the south and Cheras in the west. In the north, the Satavahanas of Andhra Pradesh were posing a threat. The alliance of Pandiyas and Cheras weakened the Chola rule drastically. The Thondai Nadu became the entry point for invasions from the north. Thus the Kalabras entered into Tamil Nadu somewhere around from north Karnataka and south Maharashtra regions. Later, they fully occupied the Chola and Pandiya regions. They followed the non-Vedic religions such as Buddhism and Jainism. It is opined by historians that they have filled a certain vacuum that had emerged after Sangam period in the political, economic, cultural and religious spheres of Tamil society. There is nothing significant to say about the Kalabras’ presence in Kanchipuram. </div>

<div class="subheadtxt">The Pallava Kingdom (600 AD – 900 AD)</div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">There is no consensus among historians about the origin of Pallavas. Some say they were the original inhabitants of the Thondai Nadu and descendants of the ancient ruler Ilantirayan. One earlier Pallava inscription at Talavanur hails Mahendra Varman I as the king of Thondai Nadu clan.  But others say they were outsiders as they issued edicts mostly in Sanskrit and Prakrit. The Pallavas too called themselves as Brahma-Kshatriyas and proclaimed their mythical lineage from Brahma. The Velurpalayam Copper plate inscriptions of 9th Century AD and the Vayalur stone inscriptions mention the real lineage of Pallava kings. The vast sculptures inside the Vaikunda Perumal temple visually depict the ancestry of Pallava dynasty. </div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">Whatever might be the origin of the Pallavas, but after coming into the Tamil region they fully merged themselves with its society. The Kalabras’ rule did not satisfy the Tamils’ aspiration for change. The then official religions like Buddhism and Jainism too supported status quo in society and aligned with the trading community. The vast majority of peasants and ordinary people were waiting for change. The powerful religious movements of Saivite Nayanmars and Vaishnavite Azhwars were gaining ground and catching people’s imagination. Exactly at this juncture the Pallavas entered into Tamil Nadu. Their rule in Kanchipuram coincided with the turbulent transitional phase of Tamil society. No wonder, some of the Pallava kings and their chiefs are included among the 63 Saivite Nayanmars. </div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">Pallava rule is classified into earlier phase and later phase. The earlier period Pallava kings ruled mostly outside Kanchi even though they claimed to have issued their royal edicts from Kanchi. As per the Velurpalayam and Vayalur inscriptions, Vira Kurchan, Skanda Varman, Kumara Vishnu and Buddha Varman are the Pallava ancestors – in chronological order. The Velurpalayam inscriptions mention that Kumara Vishnu, the son of Skanda Varman, attacked the Gathika in Kanchi and occupied the city. Gathika was the college for rulers and administrators. Especially, the Kanchi Gathika was very famous in south India. There could have been one or more Gathikas in Kanchi. Control over them symbolized the control over the city. Even though the earlier Pallavas occupied Kanchi, they could not enjoy stability due to constant outside attacks.  </div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">The later period Pallava rule was stable and closely associated with the history of Kanchi. In this lineage Simha Varman was the first king (550-560 AD). His Pallan Koil copper plate edict is very important. This is the first among the copper plate edicts in Tamil Nadu to have a royal order issued in Tamil language. Its Sanskrit part starts with the sacred word ‘Swarga’. But its Tamil part starts, replacing the usual ‘Swasthi Sree’ with ‘Kovisaya’ – pure Tamil word. It says about the land grants made by the king to the Jain temples in Tirupparuthi Kundram near Kanchipuram. This grant was given under supervision of Saint Vajra Nandhi of Nandhi Sangam. Simha Varman had two sons, namely, Simha Vishnu and Bheema Varman.  After his demise, Simha Vishnu (560 – 590 AD) came to power. Simultaneously, Simha Vishnu’s brother Bheema Varman and his descendants were in-charge of some remote parts of Pallava kingdom about which not much is known. </div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">After Simha Vishnu, his son Mahendra Varman I ascended to throne. From his time onwards, the Pallavas ruled the north, central and western parts of Tamil Nadu for 300 years until 900 AD.  In governance, trade, economy, religion, literature, art and architecture Tamil Nadu witnessed distinct progress during the Pallava rule. As
centre of all these developments, the capital city Kanchi reached zenith of its glory. </div>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="contentcenter txt">Since the days of Nirupatunga Varman the Pallava dynasty gradually became weak due to infighting and external invasions. Pandiyas and Cholas attacked from the south; Gangas from the west; Rashtrakutas and Telugu Cholas from the north. After 900 AD the Pallava Kingdom became extinct. </div>
