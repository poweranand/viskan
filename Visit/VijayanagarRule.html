<!--About Kanchipuram-->

<div class="subheadtxt">The Vijayanagar Empire (1336 – 1675 AD)</div>
<br />
<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>The Rise of the Empire</strong> - The Vijayanagara Empire was based in the Deccan Plateau of South India. It was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I. The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers against Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646 although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 by the Deccan sultanates. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose impressive ruins surround modern Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in modern Karnataka, India. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth. </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt">There is no unanimous opinion among historians regarding the origins of the Vijayanagar empire. Some claim that Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, the founders of the empire took control of the northern parts of the Hoysala Empire during its decline. Other historians propose they were Kannadigas and commanders in the army of the Hoysala Empire stationed in the Tungabhadra region to ward off Muslim invasions from the Northern India. Irrespective of their origin, historians agree the founders were supported and inspired by Vidyaranya, a saint at the Sringeri monastery to fight the Muslim invasion of South India. Writings by foreign travelers during the late medieval era combined with recent excavations in the Vijayanagar principality have uncovered much-needed information about the empire's history, fortifications, scientific developments and architectural innovations. </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt">Before the rise of the Vijayanagar Empire in the early 14th Century, the Hindu kingdoms of the Deccan, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, the Pandyan Empire of Madurai, and the tiny kingdom of Kampili had been repeatedly invaded by Muslims from the north, and by 1336 they had all been defeated by Alla-ud-din Khilji and Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Sultans of Delhi. The Hoysala Empire was the sole remaining Hindu kingdom in the path of the Muslim invasion. After the death of Hoysala Veera Ballala III during a battle against the Sultan of Madurai in 1343, the Hoysala empire merged with the growing Vijayanagar empire.  </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Krishnadevaraya (1509 – 1529 AD)</strong> - The empire reached its peak during the rule of Krishnadevaraya when Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including Kalinga, while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south. Many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of Krishnadevaraya.  Krishnadevaraya was followed by Achyuta Raya in 1530 and in 1542 by Sadashiva Raya while the real power lay with Aliya Rama Raya, the son-in-law of Krishnadevaraya, whose relationship with the Deccan Sultans who allied against him has been debated. </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Decline of the Empire</strong> - The sudden capture and killing of Rama Raya in 1565 at the Battle of Talikota, against an alliance of the Deccan sultanates, after a seemingly easy victory for the Vijayanagara armies, created havoc and confusion in the Vijayanagara ranks, which were then completely routed. The Sultanates' army later plundered Hampi and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains; it was never re-occupied. Tirumala Raya, the sole surviving commander, left Vijayanagara for Penukonda with vast amounts of treasure on the back of 550 elephants.  </div>
     
<div class="contentcenter txt">The empire went into a slow decline regionally, although trade with the Portuguese continued, and the British were given a land grant for the establishment of Madras. Tirumala Deva Raya was succeeded by his son Sriranga I later followed by Venkata II who made Chandragiri his capital, repulsed the invasion of the Bahmani Sultanate and saved Penukonda from being captured.  His successor, Ramadeva, took power and ruled till 1632 after whose death, Venkata III became king and ruled for about ten years after which Vellore was made the capital. The empire was finally conquered by the Sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda. The largest feudatories of the Vijayanagar empire — the Mysore Kingdom, Keladi Nayaka  Nayaks of Madurai, Nayaks of Tanjore, Nayakas of Chitradurga and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee — declared independence and went on to have a significant impact on the history of South India in the coming centuries. These Nayaka kingdoms lasted into the 18th century while the Mysore Kingdom remained a princely state until Indian Independence in 1947 although they came under the British Raj in 1799 after the death of Tipu Sultan.  </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Architecture</strong> - The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known at Hampi which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the Vijayanagar style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of Hindu temple construction, first in the Deccan and later in the Dravidian idioms using the local granite. Secular royal structures show the influence of the Northern Deccan Sultanate architecture. Vijayanagara architecture is a vibrant combination of the Chalukya, Hoysala, Pandiya and Chola styles. Its legacy of sculpture, architecture and painting influenced the development of the arts long after the empire came to an end. Its stylistic hallmark is the ornate pillared Kalyanamantapam (marriage hall), Vasanthamantapam (open pillared halls) and the Rajagopuram (tower). Artisans used the locally available hard granite because of its durability since the kingdom was under constant threat of invasion.  </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Kanchipuram and Vijayanagar Empire</strong> - After Harihara I, his brother Bukka I ruled the empire. He sent armies under the command of his son Kumara Kambana to Madurai in Tamil Nadu to terminate the rule of Sultans there. Thereafter Kumara Kampana was appointed as the royal representative to Kolar and the Tamil regions. He defeated the Sambuvarayas and occupied Kanchipuram. During 1361 AD to 1374 AD, 15 stone inscriptions of Kampana have been found in Kanchi.  Apart from the many land grants made by the royal authority, the inscriptions give information about the administration of Kanchi.  Six stone inscriptions of Devaraya II have been found in the Kanchi Kamakshi Amman temple. One of them reveals the fact that the king made corrective measures to stop the misuse of temple funds by local authorities.</div>
