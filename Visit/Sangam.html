<!--About Kanchipuram-->
<div class="subheadtxt">Sangam Age (600 BC – 300 AD)</div>
<div class="contentcenter txt"> This is the ancient period in the history of Tamil Nadu. The high standard Tamil literary works written during this period, called as Sangam literature, is classical in content and form and treated on par with the ancient Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, Sanskrit and Chinese literature. Except for a few Brahmi stone inscriptions no physical monuments are available belonging to that period.  Sangam literature is the only source – but a rich source - to know about that period. It is classified in to two broad categories. The first category consists of eight volumes of collected poems written by many poets. The second category consists of ten long poems each written by a different poet. All the literary works contained in these two category deal with two main themes. The first one is internal, that is, all the intricacies of intimate love between a man and a woman.  The second one is external, that is, all that are outside the purview of the first theme, such as valor etc.  </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Chola King Karikal Valavan or Karikalan</strong> -This ancient Chola king is supposed to have ruled Thondai Nadu during the second century BC.  The wild forests and original inhabitants of the region came under the control. He cleared the forests into cultivable agricultural land; dug many lakes for irrigation; and even brought many agricultural families from his Chola Nadu to settle here permanently. Karikalan fortified the city of Kanchipuram with huge walls and made it the head-quarters of Thondai Nadu. The ancient Sangam Tamil literature ‘Pattinappalai’ (one of the long ten poems) and the medieval Tamil literature ‘Periya Puranam’ have references about Karikalan’s rule in Kanchi. Medieval period Chola copper plate inscriptions also mention that Karikalan renovated Kanchi and built a wall around it. Thondai Nadu with Kanchi at its helm was made a buffer zone by king Karikalan to withstand the surge of invasions in the northern border of his Chola kingdom. </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt">There is an interesting legendary story related to Karikalan’s presence in Kanchi. In the Kanchi Kamakshi Amman temple, there is a small Sannidhi in the inner Prakaram. The figure in that Sannidhi is called ‘Meichathan’. He is a tutelary deity. Here a song has been written. Actually this song was quoted by scholar Adiyarkku Nallar in his narrative to the Tamil epic Silappadikaram. Interestingly it mentions about king Karikalan. It says that when Karikalan traveled towards north India, he came to Kanchi and worshipped Kamakshi Amman. While leaving, he took the whip named ‘Chendu’held by Meichathan. With its power, he defeated all the kings who opposed him in the north. Upon reaching Himalayas, he inscribed on the top of the hill, the figure of tiger – the royal symbol of his kingdom.</div>
     
<div class="contentcenter txt"><strong>Thondaiman Ilantirayan</strong> -  He is considered as a descendant of the original clans who inhabited Thondai Nadu. He could have ruled the region during the first century BC. Probably, after Karikalan, the Chola rulers could have appointed the native Ilantirayan as their deputy in Kanchi. The Sangam Tamil literature Perumpanatruppadai records the fact that King Ilanthirayan ruled Thondai Nadu with Kanchi as its headquarters. But, it has no reference at all about the Karikalan’s rule in Kanchi. There is a lake near Kanchipuram named ‘Tirayaneri’ bearing the name of the king Ilan Tirayan. Some legendary accounts relate Ilantirayan as descendant of Chola lineage. The epic Manimekalai has a story about the birth of Ilantirayan.  Once the Chola king Killi went to Naga kingdom. He married Naga princess Peelivalai and gave birth to a son. While returning back, the ship in which he traveled along with his son drowned due to storm. Luckily his son escaped the tragedy and washed ashore alive. The Cholas identified the child to be their own from the peculiar jewels it wore. As the child was brought back to shores by sea waves, they named him ‘Tirayan’. Tirai in Tamil means ‘wave’. The young Tirayan was made a ruler of Thondai Nadu. </div>

<div class="contentcenter txt">The Sangam Tamil literature Perumpanatruppadai   is the earliest literary source to provide an elaborate description of Kanchi. According to it, the city was beautiful, well planned and well protected. It was located in the southern bank of the Kambai river. Apart from the huge walls, it was also naturally protected by thick forests in the outer. Heavy chariots often plied through its streets. Business was very brisk in its busy markets and people most of the time engaged themselves in festivities. The city of Kanchi resembled the shape of the lotus issuing out of the navel of God Vishnu. The Yathothkari Perumal temple has also been referred to by the author of this work.  </div>
